# hello-world
This repository has been created on the go..
I was a not so good web developer now trying to be a good hybrid mobile app + web developer :)
I am not on my desk, but I still want to experiment things that are in my mind anywhere I am. So, I thought why not have access to my project on the go.. I don't have to be on my desk to work. Do I?
